# malan: MAle Lineage ANlysis

An R package (<https://www.r-project.org/>) to perform **MA**le **L**ineage **AN**lysis 
by simulating genealogies backwards and 
imposing short tandem repeats (STR) mutations forwards. 
Intended for forensic Y chromosomal STR (Y-STR) haplotype analyses. 
Numerous analyses are possible, e.g. number of matches and meiotic distance to matches.

See documentation included in package (vignettes and manual) at <https://mikldk.github.io/malan/>.

## Installation

You first need `R` (<https://www.r-project.org/>). 
Then you can install `malan` from GitHub by using the `remotes` package (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes>):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
